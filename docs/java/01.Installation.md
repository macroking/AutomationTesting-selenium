# Editor
    Popular editors for Java projects are Eclipse, IntelliJ. However, I will be using *VSCode* which you can download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/. It is available in Window, Linux and MacOS.

# Continuous Integraion
    We will use Jenkins as the CI tool.

# Docker
    We Will use docker containers to run the Jenkins build, to get more isolation and fresh environment for every build.
