# Install Python
## Windows
    1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Download the latest version or the one approved by your organization. For this tutorial I am using Python3.x.
    2. Add Python.exe to Windows path variable. E.g., `C:\Python\Python35-32\python.exe:`
    3. We will use `pip` to install Python modules required for automation.

## Linux (Ubuntu)
    1. Most or all the linux distribution comes with Python prebuilt.

# Other Libraries / Frameworks

# Editor
    Popular editor Webstrom https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/. However, I will be using *VSCode* which you can download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/. It is available in Window, Linux and MacOS.

# Docker
    We Will use docker containers to run the Jenkins build, to get more isolation and fresh environment for every build.
